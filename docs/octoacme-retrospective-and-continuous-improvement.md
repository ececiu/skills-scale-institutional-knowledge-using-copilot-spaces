# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Cross-functional Participation

### Required Attendees
- Project Manager (facilitator)
- Product Manager
- Developers (team representation)
- QA Lead
- DevOps Engineer (if involved in sprint/release)

- UX Designer (for design-heavy work)
- Business Analyst (for requirements-intensive projects)
- Customer Success Manager (especially post-release)

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes

## Action Item Accountability

When creating action items:
- **Assign clear ownership** to specific roles (e.g., "DevOps Engineer will...", "QA Lead will...")
- **Define cross-functional dependencies** (e.g., "Requires collaboration between UX Designer and Developers")
- **Set realistic timelines** based on role capacity
- **Identify success criteria** that are measurable
- **Link to relevant process docs** for context

## Follow-up and Tracking

- **Project Manager**: Tracks action items to completion and reports progress
- **Role owners**: Update status in weekly syncs
- **Team**: Reviews open action items at next retrospective
- Document completed improvements in project artifacts
