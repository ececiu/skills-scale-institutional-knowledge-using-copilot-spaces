## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)

- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)

## Project One-pager Template
- Project name:
- Problem statement:
- Objective / Goal (SMART):
- Success metrics:
- Primary stakeholders:
- Suggested timeline / milestones:
- Quick risks & dependencies:
- Proposed team / roles:

## Cross-functional Hand-offs at Initiation

### Product Manager → Business Analyst
- Hand off: High-level business objectives and success metrics
- Expected output: Detailed requirements and process analysis
- Timing: After one-pager approval, before planning kickoff

### Product Manager → UX Designer
- Hand off: User problems and desired outcomes
- Expected output: Research findings and initial design concepts
- Timing: Early in initiation to inform planning

### Project Manager → DevOps Engineer
- Hand off: Infrastructure and deployment expectations
- Expected output: Technical feasibility assessment and resource needs
- Timing: During resource planning phase

### Project Manager → QA Lead
- Hand off: Quality expectations and acceptance thresholds
- Expected output: Test strategy outline and resource estimate
- Timing: Before moving to planning phase

### Product Manager → Customer Success Manager
- Hand off: Customer value proposition and anticipated impact
- Expected output: Customer feedback and adoption considerations

## Decision Gate
Move to planning when:
- Success metrics are clear
- Stakeholders agree on priority
- Team availability is confirmed
