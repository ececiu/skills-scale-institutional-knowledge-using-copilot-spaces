# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Role Accountability in Planning

- **Collaborates with**: Product Manager (user needs), Developers (feasibility), Business Analyst (process requirements)
- **Deliverable**: Design specifications and prototype

### DevOps Engineer
- **Accountable for**: Infrastructure planning and CI/CD pipeline requirements
- **Collaborates with**: Developers (deployment needs), Project Manager (timeline), QA Lead (test environments)
- **Deliverable**: Infrastructure plan and deployment strategy

### QA Lead
- **Accountable for**: Test plan, test cases, and quality gates
- **Collaborates with**: Business Analyst (requirements), Developers (testability), UX Designer (UI acceptance)
- **Deliverable**: Test strategy and test plan document

### Developers
- **Accountable for**: Technical design and effort estimates
- **Collaborates with**: All roles for feasibility and implementation approach
- **Deliverable**: Technical design document and estimates

### Customer Success Manager

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
