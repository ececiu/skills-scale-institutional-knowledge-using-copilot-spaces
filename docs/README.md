# OctoAcme Project Management Quick Reference

Welcome to OctoAcme! This guide provides a quick overview of how we manage projects, from initial idea through release and continuous improvement. Our approach emphasizes customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. Projects follow a structured lifecycle with five key stages: **Initiation** (defining the problem, stakeholders, and timeline via a Project One-pager), **Planning** (breaking work into shippable increments, creating a prioritized backlog, and establishing a Definition of Done), **Execution** (building, testing, and reviewing in short cycles), **Release** (deploying with proper validation and stakeholder communication), and **Continuous Improvement** (capturing learnings through retrospectives). Each stage is supported by key artifacts including the Project One-pager, Risk Register, and Definition of Done—all maintained in the `docs/` folder of each project repository.

Our core personas work collaboratively to deliver value: **Project Managers (PM)** coordinate delivery, manage schedules, risks, and communications; **Product Managers (PdM)** define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success; **Developers** implement features, write tests, and participate in code reviews; **QA/Testing** validate quality against acceptance criteria; and **Stakeholders** provide inputs, feedback, and approvals. Clear ownership and psychological safety are central to our culture, ensuring every team member understands their responsibilities and feels empowered to raise concerns or propose improvements. Collaboration is fostered through shared artifacts, transparent project boards, and regular check-ins.

Communication is structured and predictable to keep everyone aligned. The team holds **daily standups** (15 minutes) to discuss progress, blockers, and dependencies, and **weekly delivery syncs** between PM and PdM to review risks, updates, and next steps. At the end of each sprint or milestone, we conduct **demos** to showcase progress and gather feedback. **Monthly stakeholder updates** ensure leadership and cross-functional partners stay informed, while **escalation paths** are clearly defined (team-level → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) to quickly address blockers or business-impacting issues. For incidents, we follow a structured playbook and schedule blameless retrospectives to learn and improve.

Quality assurance is built into every stage of delivery. Developers write **unit tests** for new logic, **integration tests** where systems interact, and **end-to-end smoke tests** for critical flows before release. All code goes through **pull request reviews** following our conventions (small PRs, linked issues, automated CI checks including security scans). CI pipelines enforce linting, testing, and security scanning before merge. Release checklists ensure deployments are validated in staging, backed by rollback plans, and accompanied by clear release notes. By embedding quality practices throughout the workflow, we deliver reliable, maintainable software that meets customer needs and business goals.
